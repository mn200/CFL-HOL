  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the formal verification of a compiler front-end
that translates a subset of the C language into the Cminor
intermediate language.  The semantics of the source and target
languages as well as the translation between them have been written in
the specification language of the Coq proof assistant. The proof of
observational semantic equivalence between the source and generated
code has been machine-checked using Coq.  An executable compiler was
obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq
specification of the translator, combined with a certified compiler
back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in
previous work.},
